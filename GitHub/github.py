# This script will be run every hour for an entire week
# Another option (probably better, but more work to find out how I think) would be to
#  let this script set up automatic pings in the specified interval in ripe atlas for all probes

# List of all locations from where we'll ping (+-10 per continent)

# Do tests from each location
# Ping GitHub

# If first time today, perform a traceroute

# Store the found data for future analysis
